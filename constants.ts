asti monday ko lagi really sorry hai. You have no idea how worried i was when i heard the news and you weren't reachable.
I wasn't worried much about the protest as i was worried about the news that the government has fallen. It is worst time for the people safety.tyo bela ta peopleâ€™s safety sab bhanda big challenge huncha.Since you were not reachable, i was more worried. So i decided to come home. While i was about to leave for the airport, hajur ko tyo mail ayo,full of anger..instead of just telling me tyaha ko situation kasto cha, how's you, ani Mom and bhai ko k khabar cha.

By the way how is your prepartion going for the exam?

suna na can you please take back Mom ko promise. Aba festival month start huncha. Dashain ni start bhayo..then dipawali ani chhath puja.

Hajur lai tha cha, asti Ghana jane time flight ma euta sathi banaye. He works in BlackRock company ani usle mero recommendation garyo afno company ma, i wasn't expecting but i got response within 2 days nai. Telephone interview ta Ghana mai bhayo. 

Technical round friday ko din schedule thyo but yaha ghar tira yeti dherai pani pari ra thyo ki bati ga ko gai thyo, ani mobile data ko speed ramro thiyena so aja rati 1 baje tira coding round start huncha cha. 

It's been more than 3 months since you blocked me, can you please take back Mom ani Didi ko promise and unblock me. I have so much things, photos and stories to show and share... I have been waiting for months that you will take back the promise you gave me once your anger goes down. Aba festival ni ayo ani hajur lai tha nai cha how excited i get to share photos and all the stories specially during these festival months or any puja.

You remember that Dove bird, he is still alive,but one of his eye is gone. Yesterday we made a home for him. We also made candle. But recently usko favorite thau mero laptop bhako,laptop open gare ko herne bitikai ayera basdincha.

You know am thinking of buying a DJI drone. India ma expensive cha ani nepal ma ta jhan. Naya model ko price bhanda ni badhi ko price ma old model dira chan yeta tira. But i wanna buy new model, recently launched. It has bigger camera sensor and an array of omni-directional senesors.It is perfectly the way wanted to buy. If any of your relatives coming from US this Dashain or Diwali , then do let me know la.
